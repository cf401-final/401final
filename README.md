## Problem Domain:

We want to create a bulletin board system that will allow a user to post an item for sale to a wide audience.

- **MVP:** System will allow a user to:
  - sign up
  - sign in
  - subscribe to a channel or topic to receive notifications
  - add an item for sale to a database that generates a message to subscribers
- **Stretch goal:** Create multiple channels on a variety of topics
- **Stretch goal:** Post a message to a message board
- **Stretch goal:** Send a direct message to another user
